Simple website to help peeps get color inspired ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

Currently, this js scripted random color generator only offers #hex combinations but eventually I'll add other color type options.

### How it works

Use the "click me" button to generate a random #hex.
The site's background color will update with the color generated.
If you like the color just click "copy me" to save it to your clipoard.
And there you go, you gotz inspired like crazy and are ready to create!
